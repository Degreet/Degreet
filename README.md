Self-taught backend developer from Ukraine 🇺🇦, shaped by production failures — not tutorials.  
Built on real systems, real mistakes, and shipping code that actually works.

I believe programming isn't just a skill. It's a way of thinking. A discipline.  
I write code the way some people practice martial arts — with intent, form, and obsession over the details nobody sees.

<br/>

### 📌 Projects

**[NestFinance](https://github.com/Degreet/nest-finance)** `NestJS · TypeScript · PostgreSQL · AWS`  
A financial management REST API focused on clean architecture,  
financial precision, and production-grade infrastructure.

<br/>

### 🧭 What drives me

- Building backend systems that are both **reliable and beautiful** under the hood
- Automation at scale — queues, failover, AI integration
- Architecture that makes you stop and think *"damn, this is clean"*
